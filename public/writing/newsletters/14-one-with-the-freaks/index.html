      <p>Dear friends, it’s been a while. Please apologize my absence – I’m not quite sure what happened. Maybe it was a mixture of rainy day mood swings, busy University days and long, demotivating train rides between Potsdam (where my University is) and Neukölln (where my home is) that kept me from jotting down this humble monthly sheet of words. But I am back. Here are the news.</p>
<p>1 — I watched the 2017 version of Ghost In The Shell a couple of weeks ago. Knowing that I am late to the game by now, I still want to share some thoughts. The first time I stumbled upon the anime was in 1999, when one-hit wonder Wamdue Project used the famous “Making of a Cyborg” scenes in their music video for “King Of My Castle” (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwdlqquJDK4">YouTube link</a>). While I didn’t fully understand the philosophical depth behind the original story, I always noted the cultural significance Mamoru Oshii’s anime kept until today.</p>
<p>The story takes place in 2029, which is only 12 years away from today. I found it particularly interesting to compare the futurescapes which the 1995 and the 2017 movie versions paint. While the anime version creates a dystopian urban jungle with a very grey, olive, dusty color palette, Scarlet Johansson runs through a neon-blue and light-polluted LED-city besieged by advertising holograms. I recommend <a href="https://twitter.com/monikabielskyte/status/844962977564495873">scrolling through the set of moodboards and thoughts</a> by designer Monika Bielskyte, who was involved in creating the movie’s visual direction in the beginning. The moodboards stick to the overall cyberpunk topic, but some of them are much less dystopian and cold than the end result.</p>
<p>2 — So much for the sci-fi nerd talk. Admittedly, I am not even that much into all this stuff, but with Ghost In The Shell, it was different; and comparing the past to the present (with a little bit of future) is always interesting. In this semester, I am participating in a research project about the early stages of the home computer. We are time-traveling through the 1970s, ’80s, and early ’90s, when the internet was very far away from being at our fingertips, and companies were trying hard to make up reasons why a regular household would need a personal computer.</p>
<p>I cannot even remember a point in time where our home computer did not have an internet connection. Sure, it was not part of our everyday life, and as a kid, I mainly used the computer for games and creating crappy PowerPoint animations. I would say that being born in the early 90s, my generation is not only digital native, but also internet native. It’s nice to dig through research, advertisements and general perceptions of life where this crucial tool called Internet just wasn’t even existent.</p>
<p>3 — Speaking of computer nostalgia: This Guardian article reminds us about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2017/mar/15/official-film-websites-youve-got-mail-jurassic-park-space-jam?">“the forgotten world of 90s movie websites”</a>.</p>
<p>The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/entertainment/unrealistic-nyc-apartments/?tid=sm_tw&amp;utm_term=.09355e658c85">compares the apartments</a> of New York’s famous TV shows (like GIRLS and Friends) to reality. This would be very interesting for Berlin, too.</p>
<p>People with odd attitudes are usually quite inspiring. Like Karl Lagerfeld, who explains his daily routines in the <a href="http://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/a865/24-hours-with-karl-lagerfeld-0412/">Harper’s BAZAAR series</a>.</p>
<p>I played around with <a href="https://anchor.fm/">Anchor.fm</a> briefly. The concept is simple: Like an audio version of Snapchat, users can create radio stations that disappear after 24 hours. It’s a very well-made and fun app, and from time to time, I mumble German mumblings into my phone’s mic. If you want, you can download the app and <a href="https://anchor.fm/s/a5a514">follow my station</a>.</p>
<p>4 — Upcoming: Later this month, I’ll be writing for Berlin’s <a href="http://www.typotalks.com/news/?icl-en">TYPO conference</a>. We catch the conference behind the scenes and front row, and there are lots of great speakers, as every year. Follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/TYPOBER">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/typotalks/">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TYPO.Berlin/">Facebook</a>.</p>
