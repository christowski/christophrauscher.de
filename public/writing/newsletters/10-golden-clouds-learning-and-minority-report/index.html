I will be studying there for the next one or two years. On my way, I pass through Grunewald, which is really one giant cloud of golden leaves right now, and lots of lakes. Berlin is very watery, and Potsdam is very tidy. However, the first two weeks of University left my mind in a very untidy state. So much input! Here are just two fragments of things I stumbled upon:</p><p>I read about the PIBA-DIBA proposal, for example: A guidance to blend the Digital with the Physical (<a href="http://hci.uni-konstanz.de/downloads/blend13_hurtienne.pdf">paper here</a>). It basically gives two lists to designers, based on: „Physical Is Better At“ vs. „Digital Is Better At“, with the intention to direct the designer’s focus to beneficial aspects of using digital vs. physical objects. Another interesting topic I stepped into was the design methodology of „Design Fiction“. In <a href="http://v2.nl/archive/articles/design-fiction">this essay</a>, Julian Bleeker explains how science fiction is a powerful way of innovating and pushing ideas to a wider audience (you all remember the crazy interfaces in <em>Minority Report,</em> and how fragments of them slowly drip into our lives, and how their designer John Underkoffler actually <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/john_underkoffler_drive_3d_data_with_a_gesture?language=en#t-288072">made them reality</a>).</p><p>My Dropbox is filled with PDFs, TED talks, and about 100 links to Google Scholar papers. What I find hard is to manage all this input. I have the feeling that I forgot how to learn. And I am not talking about this new kind of learning; interactive and revolutionized methods leading to epiphanies, adaptable to the “real world”. I am talking about learning in its purest, dullest format: sitting at a desk, my nose and eyes buried in books, folders and my laptop, with blue ink stains on my lips from chewing on my pen (gross). Obviously this is due to my broken attention span (on that note, I enjoyed Douglas Forsters thoughts on <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/how-to-rebuild-an-attention-span/279326/">How to Rebuild an Attention Span</a>), and my three-year-pause of being a student.</p><p>With the luxury of my planned studies, I got to think about my desk and learning setup a little more the past month. While I find it okay to read on my tablet on the train or sit in our University’s very nice and quiet library, I really cherish my own home office. Or maybe I’d like to call it “my study” from now on. It’s a place to really sit down and focus, surround myself with paper and technology, and get lost in this area for a little while. It just never feels unproductive.</p><p>With the setup of a proper working environment, I found myself curious and critical over the latest release of Apple’s new MacBook Pro and the Microsoft Surface Studio. Both being doubtlessly powerful machines, their hardware design is lacking character. I really have a thing for outdated technology, and every time I watch old TV series where someone self-importantly hacks into an iMac G3 “for homework”, I feel all fuzzy and nostalgic. The site <a href="http://www.starringthecomputer.com/">Starring The Computer</a> provides a ridiculously large collection of computer appearances on TV and in movies.</p><p>Also in October:</p><p>A — Rixdorf, the historic town center of Neukölln, and I finally became reconciled. I used to hate Neukölln in the dark autumn and winter months, but the area around here got so much nicer. There is a real bakery, a book store, and I even visit the bar around the corner from time to time.</p><p>B — While I try to get used to academic writing (I took a crash course at University, and am reading much more academic papers), I also felt like not writing like a robot from time to time. A reminder in my phone pushes me for one diary entry per day. I don’t always do it, but I do it more often now, which is very soul-cleansing™.</p><p>C — Other than that: It just started raining, and I was so so so motivated to go out for some physical activity this evening. But ok. I might just stay at home, in my study, and watch the outside slowly turning into winter. Have a great start into November!</p></div></div></article></main><footer><div class="footer-nav--primary"><div class="social"><a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@christowski" target="_blank"><img src="/media/mastodon.svg" title="@christowski" alt="Mastodon Toots"></a><a href="https://instagram.com/christowski" target="_blank"><img src="/media/instagram.svg" title="Instagram: christowski" alt="Instagram Photos"></a><a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/rauscherchristoph" target="_blank"><img src="/media/linkedin.svg" title="LinkedIn" alt="LinkedIn Profile"></a></div><div><a class="scroll" href="#">↖ Back to top</a></div></div><div class="footer-nav--secondary"><ul><li><a href="/newsletter">Newsletter</a></li><li><a href="https://christophrauscher.de/11ty/feed.xml">RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/colophone">Colophone</a></li><li><a href="/imprint">Imprint</a></li><li><a href="/everything">Everything</a></li></ul><div><p>2024 &copy; Christoph Rauscher</p></div></div></footer></div></body></html>
