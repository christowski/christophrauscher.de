      <p>Like every morning, my eyes open at 5:55am. Partly because of my inner clock, but also because my thoughts tumble around and wake me up. I start laying out tasks for the day, and conversations I need to conduct; I push words around like letters on a scrabble board, and while I end up with perfect formulations at 5:55, I usually miss out on using them during the day. I stay in bed until 7:30, sometimes 9:00am. Then I get up.</p>
<hr>
<p>On the last day of this year (you are probably reading this in 2019 already, so take this as a greeting from the past and send it to the archives), I got up at 8:00am sharp. I went to a supermarket and bought three zucchinis. Then I re-read the newsletter I sent out <a href="https://tinyletter.com/christowski/letters/you-think-you-might-not-get-through-it-but-you-do">one year ago</a>. It was titled “You Think You Might Not Get Through It But You Do”. That’s probably what I learned throughout this year: You <em>actually</em> do. I finished a lot of things this year; I got a master’s degree, I worked with a lot of great people, and I worked on a lot of things including myself. I end this year being torn between totally agreeing to Jerry Salz’s statement “Work is the only thing that takes the curse of fear away” (I <a href="https://christowski.de/blog/2018/12/forget-being-a-genius-and-develop-some-skills/">blogged</a> about his great piece on being an artist), and accepting that <em>not working</em> might sometimes actually be the best cure for my nervous self. I might find out in 2019. Don’t cry—work. If you feel like it.</p>

<p>What follows are the occasional recommendations from around the web. E.g. Austin Kleon’s weblog, in particular <a href="https://austinkleon.com/2018/12/21/surfs-up/">this exploration</a> of the metaphor “surfing the web“.</p>
<p>I enjoyed <a href="https://story.californiasunday.com/at-home">this piece</a> by the California Sunday Magazine about Homes. They photographed and talked to a variety of people where and how they feel at home, and the audio layer of the piece makes it extra-intimate.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I decided to move my blog’s home from Tumblr to a self-hosted system again. I made tons of posts (dating back to 2006!) private, and kept only the writing I still like public. When Tumblr decided to apply content filters as of Dec. 17, I already left the platform. Malte’s tweet summed up my feelings perfectly: “take this recent tumblr crackdown as a reminder that this is still the web. you can learn to build and own your own platforms.” <a href="https://twitter.com/electricgecko/status/1069746149396004864">(12/4/2018)</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Drawing the 2018-Finishing-Line: Fear has been, yet again, way to dominant in my year, and I want to continue working on taming it. Besides that, I want to become better at using those formulations I make at 5:55am, I want to become better at taking up space, and more intent at making decisions. I hope you all had a great year and have some (not too many!) plans for 2019. Stay safe and sound, Yours truly—Christoph.</p>
