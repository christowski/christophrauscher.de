      <p>I am sitting in between towers of moving boxes, filled with my clothes, my books, my stuff – just so much <em>stuff</em> that needs to change coordinates with me. I am moving! Well, I did—that’s what I spent the whole November and December with. Packing things up in boxes is a cathartic process. I wasn’t able to get rid of as many things as I wished, but eventually, I took this as a sign that I am already surrounded by the things I love, and I want to keep them. Ok, most of them.</p>
<p>Finding space for all this life within a new place is a long and exhausting (and sometimes also expensive) process, and every once in a while, I need to remind myself that this is all fun and I am doing it for me and I finally get to decorate and design everything exactly the way I want to. I cannot help but wonder: Is it <em>more</em> difficult to chose a wall color when you're a visual thinker; an aesthete? Shouldn’t it be easier? Maybe I am just a slow decision maker, and that’s ok, too. I’ll get there.</p>
<hr>
<p>As 2022 comes to an end, let’s briefly look at the hard facts and feelings:</p>
<p>I moved into a new apartment, which was an unbelievable (the apartment is perfect!) and stressful (I have not done this in quite a while!) process. However, I am here now, lurking out of all those boxes that still need to be unpacked. Home makes me very happy and thankful.</p>
<p>I had several teaching jobs in 2022: Web design at Merz Academy, my annual <em>Writing = Design</em> workshop week with Sonja, and a whole semester’s course at UdK on writing about illustration. All these jobs were completely different, but I got the chance to find out that a) I want to do more of it, and b) I developed a better understanding for how my style of teaching and working with students could work. Now, let’s see where it fits in.</p>
<p>In July, we founded our cooperative: <a href="https://village.one/">Village One</a>. Since then, we’ve been talking to other coops, thought a lot about our company approach, and obviously did some work, too: For example, we helped Neue Narrative to rebrush their website, we teamed up with Cobot to do a big research project, and we work closely together with Publix, a new house for Journalism in Berlin; building their digital infrastructure. I definitely enjoy the variety, but I sometimes miss the office buzz you normally get with a company. Working remotely and alone at home as a freelancer is fine, but teaming up with others feels different when you meet at the kitchen table. Anyway, a lot is planned for 2023 with Village One; <a href="https://www.village.one/garden/newsletter">follow us</a> if you're curious. We're also <a href="https://www.village.one/garden/open-positions/profile-digital-product-designer">looking for a designer</a> to join the team!</p>
<p>I continued writing my little column for the form design magazine: This year, I wrote about the cloud (295), desktop publishing (296), buttons (297) and phone sex (298). You can see some videos about the columns on <a href="http://instagram.com/christowski/">my Instagram</a>, and buy the magazine <a href="http://form.de/">online</a>.</p>
<p>Both writing and drawing exercises felt a little thin this year. I miss it, but other big projects occupied my desk. However, I did write my monthly diary recaps on the blog (<a href="https://christowski.de/blog/tag/tagebuchbloggen/">find them here</a>) and I was involved in two book projects: For Lorenz Meyer’s “Kreuzfahrt durch die Republik” I <a href="https://www.rowohlt.de/buch/lorenz-meyer-kreuzfahrt-durch-die-republik-9783499009983">drew</a> cover + portraits, and for Gabriel Yoran’s new <a href="https://www.bod.de/buchshop/wenn-das-leben-dir-zitronen-gibt-mach-dressing-draus-gabriel-yoran-9783982095882">Genussbuch</a> »Wenn das Leben dir Zitronen gibt, mach Dressing draus« I drew the cover and some spots. Next year, I want to make something just for myself. More depth, less instagram.</p>
<p>What else? I travelled places! I am not a traveller, it makes me nervous and I find it so exhausting that I forget about the beauty and the new input I bring home with me. I went to Vienna (I love you!), I spent my time in pools and restaurants in Greece, I went to Rome and ate all the things. It was nice. Let’s say it like that: I am not into traveling, but I do enjoy a nice vacation. Find me at the pool.</p>
<hr>
<p>As December’s days rush by so quickly, another year is put to the archives. Boxes, archives, folders – how are these the symbols of my year?! Sorry that this letter turned into some work-focussed yada yada, with little wisdom and no new year’s predictions from within my crystal ball. Current times are so wonky, I decided to avoid outlooks and be more here, in this tower of boxes—in this slice of air and time.</p>
<p>I haven’t written this letter in a while, but it feels good to be back at it. How has your year been? What comes next? Send me a reply, if you like, or we’ll find each other in other ways in the next year; it’s almost there. Another year, another round, make it count.</p>
