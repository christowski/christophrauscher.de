      <p><em>On magic:</em> It’s March 2020 and I’m on a video call with a friend. We’re all new to this whole stay-at-home situation, and she had offered to lay her Tarot cards for me. She’s using playing cards of <em>Magic: The Gathering,</em> just to spice things up a bit. The cards tell me about the general situation (<em>Silent Attendant:</em> “The Answer to life should never be death; it should always be more life, wrapped tight around us like precious silks”), they give precise recommendations (<em>The Bandage:</em> “Prevent the next damage that would be dealt to any target”), and conclude a possible outcome of it all (<em>The Arcane Laboratory:</em> “It soon became obvious that some experiments were best overseen by fireproof teachers”).</p>
<p><em>On waves:</em> Admittedly, I do not believe in Tarot, but as we were (and still are) facing months of uncertainty, I enjoyed its randomness. There’s always something to get out of it—if you just read between the lines. So I’m digging into the year: Every other month, I got overwhelmed with pandemic anxiety, but over time, dealing with it became easier. The constant decision-making, weighing reason with facts, desires and relationships was probably the most exhausting part.</p>
<p>While it was widely accepted to be stressed and anxious during the first wave, it feels less tolerated in the current situation: Everybody needs to have their shit together by now. I don’t like that. I liked that everybody talked about how they’re feeling all the time; admitting exhaustion, fears and uncertainty. I want that to stay even after Corona. We will all get better at expressing it.</p>

<p>I listened to a lot of Charli XCX this year. Here’s an interesting <a href="https://youtu.be/ooAuteRHyD0">introduction to Hyperpop</a> (if you were wondering what all the Tumblr Vaporwave kids were up to now). A plan for next year is to actually tidy up my Spotify playlists—for now, you can tune in to my <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0jTorj2RaY71vkErDwyJh5?si=YWaWj3KRQeuJOOM6eE0P_w">public playlist</a>. This letter’s headline is from my song of the year: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwwUjyxJB0Q"><em>Rub My Eyes</em></a> by Hearts Hearts.</p>
<p>A book that I keep thinking about is Ottessa Moshfegh’s “My Year of Rest and Relaxation.” I read it in January and it somehow set the scene for the months to come. Follow my readings on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/108641444-christoph">Goodreads</a>, if you like.</p>
<p>As people are talking about <a href="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history">digital gardens</a> and <a href="https://colly.com/articles/this-used-to-be-our-playground">mourn the days</a> of personal online publishing, I am happy to point out: Weblogs do still exist! For example: <a href="https://medium.com/@gabrielberlin">Gabriel</a>, <a href="http://www.sheepish.de/">Nina</a>, <a href="http://uarrr.org/">Marcel</a>, <a href="http://mevme.com/lizblog/">Lisa</a>, <a href="http://andreas-spiegler.de/">Andreas</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>For the new year, I encourage you to read between the lines. Read between anything! There’s always stuff to carve out. And for now: Let’s stay at home as much as we can, to <em>prevent the next damage that would be dealt to any target.</em> Another year, another round, make it count.</p>
