      <p>There is this one incredibly strong memory in my head that, when triggered, makes be both very happy and very sad. It goes as follows: When I grew up, I had a big tomcat named Kasimir. He was a soft and gentle animal, and as we both knew each other from a very young age, we were very attached. He enjoyed being held like a baby; his arms wrapped around my neck, me gently swaying him—really, just like a baby. I remember his fur, his scent and flat face pushing against mine. His big paws. I remember everything. And the fact that I remember, even though he died about 8 years ago, gives me a lot of comfort. I might remember it forever. I hope I will.</p>
<p>Together with the comfort of this memory, I’ve spent the past weeks in my apartment, as probably most of you. Just occasionally I went went out to see friends with a distance. We walked along the canal, around Kreuzberg, looking at people and houses. I’ve enjoyed observing the slow progress of coffee shops and ice cream parlors re-opening, arranging themselves with the safety restrictions. Everyone has been extra-friendly, it seemed, and that made me happy. It should stay like that. I hope it does.</p>
<p>I also noticed that the activities I do with friends are a lot more active and thought-through. We go on bike tours, we explore unknown parts of the city, and we share more feelings. I tried making a list of what stays from this pandemic on an interpersonal level, and this should be one of the things. I hope so.</p>
<p>When I walk around my neighborhood now, everything seems to be back to normal. The bridges and parks are full of people, the smell of weed and take-away pizza is everywhere. I get invitations to gatherings; people are dating again; and when I hear loud house music from a party in the park, I want to believe that we can all relax and live summer as we were used to. But I don’t think I’m ready yet, to be honest. It doesn’t feel right. And so I stay here, with my memories and video calls and bike rides, watching cats on TikTok, remembering Kasimir, seeing one friend at a time. It will get better. I’m sure it will.</p>

<p>I read Rachel Cusks <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49555919-outline">“Outline”</a>. That’s what it is; an outline; observations loosely tied together in a story. I tend to enjoy books where nothing happens, and this is one of them, but some sentences Cusk writes are just very on point.</p>
<p>I wrote a brief love letter to the <a href="https://christowski.de/blog/2020/05/the-last-screensaver-an-ode-to-flurry/">Flurry screensaver</a>, which you probably know from your Mac or from computers in movies.</p>
<p>I also wrote a <a href="https://christowski.de/blog/2020/05/a-postcard-from-the-living-room/">postcard from my living room</a>. It was a writing prompt from <a href="https://www.suleikajaouad.com/the-isolation-journals">The Isolation Journals</a> by Suleika Jaouad. Highly recommended newsletter!</p>
<p>The weekly (German) YouTube series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bnmDsAu068&amp;list=PLs9YrN8ZVAm7HKU23B8OoyACBHJamfZ-3">“Social Distancing”</a> by Hazel Brugger and Thomas Spitzer is the most wholesome thing to watch on a Sunday (or any day).</p>
<hr>
<p>What are your old memories that make you feel all the feels? Think about them for a minute or two. It’s a nice thing to hold on to. And in case you have a cat: Give him or her a big kiss and pat on the head from me. If you have a dog, please do the same. I hope you’re all safe and well and finding your way through these troubled times.</p>
