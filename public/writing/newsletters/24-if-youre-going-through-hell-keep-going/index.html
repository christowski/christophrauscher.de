It’s some rainy weekend in October, and I am supposed to give a talk about my work during the upcoming week. I am paralyzed.</p><p>I used to give presentations quite frequently; I would even say that it used to be one of my best-trained designer muscles. But during that weekend I noticed how rusty I’ve gotten; how tricky I found it to draw a line without an actual pencil; and how shaky my voice gets while it peeks on the speaker notes. On the other hand: I really, genuinely enjoy it. I love talking about design, about an idea or a craft or a process, drawing that story line and deciding what’s worth saying and what isn’t. I just haven’t done it in a very long time.</p><p>So, as I am sitting at my desk, blank page horror in full blossom, I text my friend Ralf about my sorrows. He reminds me of a very basic wisdom: “If it doesn’t work, keep doing it—it’ll come to you eventually.” <em>If you’re going through hell, keep going.</em> It sounds cheesy, plain and overly dramatic, but drama helps, ffs sake; <em>emotions help!,</em> and it has a whole lot of truth to it. In the end, that stroll through hell saved me yet again: After I finished the slides and after the presentation was given and when I allowed myself to be relieved, I noticed: Wow, It’s good to be reunited with something I really like. Winning that spark back wasn’t as hard after all, it just felt so for a little part of the way.</p><hr><p>Speaking of speaking: In October, I was invited by <a href="https://stanhema.com">StanHema</a> to talk about my design work and its relation to writing and text. That was fun, because as as we all know: <em>Design is writing is design,</em> and sorting and sharing all these connections in my head was really motivating and eye-opening.</p><p>I also noticed that this September marked my 10-year-anniversary in Berlin. I’ve always imagined to write a huge thinkpiece on how this city changed me, my life, my believes etcetera yada yada, so that in the end, I just published a <a href="https://christowski.de/blog/2019/10/zehn-jahre-berlin/">list of random thoughts.</a></p><p>Learned about myself: I’m really into poetry. Actually I’ve always been, I just didn’t want to admit it, and I only like the weird stuff. <a href="https://christowski.de/blog/2019/10/rilke-das-stunden-buch/">And Rilke.</a></p><p>Even more links: I enjoyed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y78duqy-RyI">this documentary</a> about elderly people who speed-date (German); I learned a lot about Susan Sontag in <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/09/23/susan-sontag-and-the-unholy-practice-of-biography">this article</a> about writing her biography; and I always admire <a href="http://www.robrie.com/">Robert Rieger’s</a> photography and especially his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/robertrieger/">instagram posts</a>.</p><hr><p>I hope you’re all on a safe stroll off of any hell-like trails, but if you’re in the thick of one: Keep going! Have a blissful start into November.</p></div></div></article></main><footer><div class="footer-nav--primary"><div class="social"><a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@christowski" target="_blank"><img src="/media/mastodon.svg" title="@christowski" alt="Mastodon Toots"></a><a href="https://instagram.com/christowski" target="_blank"><img src="/media/instagram.svg" title="Instagram: christowski" alt="Instagram Photos"></a><a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/rauscherchristoph" target="_blank"><img src="/media/linkedin.svg" title="LinkedIn" alt="LinkedIn Profile"></a></div><div><a class="scroll" href="#">↖ Back to top</a></div></div><div class="footer-nav--secondary"><ul><li><a href="/newsletter">Newsletter</a></li><li><a href="https://christophrauscher.de/11ty/feed.xml">RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/colophone">Colophone</a></li><li><a href="/imprint">Imprint</a></li><li><a href="/everything">Everything</a></li></ul><div><p>2024 &copy; Christoph Rauscher</p></div></div></footer></div></body></html>
