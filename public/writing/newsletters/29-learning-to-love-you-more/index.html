And as we didn’t have any plans, we decided to put our masks on and have a look around. The gallery showed a collection of installations and sculptures, mostly focussed on internet art, and the artist’s exploitation. When we walked through the rooms, passing by a giant print of Alex Tew’s Million Dollar Homepage, I saw it in a corner: A tiny desk with a laptop, showing the website <a href="http://learningtoloveyoumore.com/">learningtoloveyoumore.com</a>.</p><p><em>Learning to Love You More</em> was an interactive project by Miranda July and Harrell Fletcher that ran until 2009. The website listed a number of assignments that people could fulfill and send in their results, which were then exhibited on the site. 39: Take a picture of your parents kissing. 35: Ask your family to describe what you do. 66: Make a field guide to your yard. 5: Recreate an object from someone's past. I knew this site! When we were teenagers, me and my friends did some of the assignments, and they can still be found online. I had totally forgotten about the site and how much joy these tasks and perspectives brought to me. Asking my parents to kiss for a picture was weird and memorable. I actually enjoy creating those kinds of moments. Rediscovering the website on the tiny desk at Kunstraum Kreuzberg reminded me about it.</p><hr><p>Right now, it’s 9.55pm, I am sitting in my living room. As I turn my stiff neck towards the window, I catch the blue hour; tinting the house across the street in a tender blue, almost purple color. It’s not going to last long, I can see it passing by. Like most summer evenings. Like me cycling through Weserstraße, on my way home from a dinner with a friend. That’s when I usually catch the blue hour, too. All this won’t last long: The people sitting outside their Spätis, drinking beers, the kids running around with their dogs, the warm air and me and my bike: This is what we longed for the whole winter, and realizing every year anew that it’s worth the wait — It’s an easy thought, and I like it. I like <em>easy,</em> sometimes.</p><hr><p>One thing I am trying to learn is to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CBWQq-QnShK/">smile in pictures</a>.</p><p>One thing I already learned is that I don’t need to please everybody all the time (cool!). Now, however, I am scared that people might not like the new Me who doesn’t want to be liked by everybody. It’s a vicious circle.</p><p>On a bit more light-hearted note: I went looking for the best-designed watering can out there and wrote a little <a href="https://christowski.de/blog/2020/06/ueber-design-giesskannen/">design critique</a> (in German).</p><p>And to stop blathering about Corona in this newsletter, I wrote a Corona diary for German <em>form</em> design magazine, which you can <a href="https://form.de/products/form-288-krise-und-design">buy here</a>. The current issue deals with Crisis and Design, and I can highly recommend ordering it!</p><hr><p>Here’s my <em>Learning to Love You More</em> assignment to you: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6LLl2tvQel0dJiTLQpTAUE?si=cJEtPsO4RVO25izpav-KSw">Educate yourself</a> on your internalised racisms. Fight them. Keep on learning and strengthening your senses; speak up, and learn <a href="http://docs.google.com/document/d/1zh6reFJWkZRGBL5iIezTfA2tkKBB3X9JcMh2QYT8tWk/edit">what to do next</a> – Hire black illustrators, for example. <a href="https://twitter.com/matty_huynh/status/1269244326015651840?s=20">Here is a list</a> to get started with. In between, you can put the phone or computer away and go outside. Cycle through summer, because as we all know: It won’t last as long as we’d like to.</p></div></div></article></main><footer><div class="footer-nav--primary"><div class="social"><a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@christowski" target="_blank"><img src="/media/mastodon.svg" title="@christowski" alt="Mastodon Toots"></a><a href="https://instagram.com/christowski" target="_blank"><img src="/media/instagram.svg" title="Instagram: christowski" alt="Instagram Photos"></a><a href="https://de.linkedin.com/in/rauscherchristoph" target="_blank"><img src="/media/linkedin.svg" title="LinkedIn" alt="LinkedIn Profile"></a></div><div><a class="scroll" href="#">↖ Back to top</a></div></div><div class="footer-nav--secondary"><ul><li><a href="/newsletter">Newsletter</a></li><li><a href="https://christophrauscher.de/11ty/feed.xml">RSS Feed</a></li><li><a href="/colophone">Colophone</a></li><li><a href="/imprint">Imprint</a></li><li><a href="/everything">Everything</a></li></ul><div><p>2024 &copy; Christoph Rauscher</p></div></div></footer></div></body></html>
