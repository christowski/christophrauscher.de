    <p>The <em>Falter</em> is a renowned weekly newspaper from Vienna, known for its left-oriented political commentary, and broad cultural coverage of the city. The newspaper has been published since 1977, and until recently, the main focus was the printed issue.</p>
    <p>For the redesign, we aimed to keep the underground and alternative spirit of the Falter brand. Originally printed as a tabloid-sized magazine, I enjoyed delving though the newspaper’s archives, gathering inspiration and visual cues that could be transported to a present, more contemporary digital reading experience.</p>
    <p>Additionally to the visual redesign, the key goals were a much faster and more accessible web experience, as well as a broader, better display of Falter’s offering.</p>
    <p>Head of product: Florian Jungnikl-Gossy. Head of development: Lukas Kienzl.</p>

    <p>Besides its political commentary and cultural city coverage, Falter publishes some of Austria’s most-played podcasts, offers a broad range of newsletters as well as restaurant guides, a big event section and a country-wide film guide, including reviews.</p>
    <p>For the redesign, we developed different layouts and access points for the numerous guides and content types. Readers now get a more curated overview of Vienna’s goings-on about town—and for the editors, a new CMS system was set up to make content production easier and faster.</p>

    <p>I designed a broad set of teasers to feature various contents, from theatre critics to political debates. As the page used to be focussed solely on the print issues, there was not much content navigation and tagging structure available. The redesign includes a clearer navigation based on topics and content types, as well as big visual entry points to articles of interest.</p>
    <p>Additionally to the overall website design, I drew a set of spot illustrations to guide readers: From newsletters to restaurant guides, from opinion pieces to podcasts and videos:</p>

    <p>The website redesign features many little visual cues to the past. Besides the marquee (a two-colored ribbon taken from a print layout from the 1980s), little spot illustations, wiggly lines and stars create a handmade, almost zine-like character for the digital publication.</p>
    <p>The yellow color draws back to a very early site design (which was around for much longer than anticipated), and points towards the long history of the newspaper, as well as its independent, self-made and opinionated character.</p>
