From June 26 on, Meta will update its privacy policy to train its AI tools on user data. Instagram and Facebook users in the EU and UK can opt-out of that, through a dubious and somewhat wonky <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91132854/instagram-training-ai-on-your-data-its-nearly-impossible-to-opt-out" target="_blank">request form</a>. I mainly use Instagram to share my illustrations and writing, and quite frankly, I don’t want Meta to use this data to train their language models. So I opted out.

To be honest though, I’m not sure if that really is of any use. I can’t believe that they haven’t scraped that data yet; they sure have. But the whole discussion, yet again, opens a bigger question of whether we should use platforms like Instagram in the first place (the answer is: No).

It has never been a good idea to upload our art and writing to Meta-owned or big-tech platforms (be it Instagram, Pinterest, Behance, and the likes; basically anything of larger scale that is largely VC-funded at jumps on the AI train). With Meta now feeding our work to large language models to generate replicas of it (and do whatever other stupid things), it’s time to finally drop it. It sucks.

I am not a big artist on Instagram. I do not have a huge following or exposure there. But I have a sense of ethics, and I really hate what big tech is doing. Reflecting on Instagram and how it changed over the years—it really does more harm than good (to me). 

I know that I can <a href="https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu" target="_blank">“glaze”</a> my images and make them unusable for AI, at least for now. I might do that for some of my works, I think it’s an important tool and research project. Honestly though, I don’t want to use Instagram in the first place. It is, in big parts, a very hostile environment. Do you sometimes read the comments there? It’s wild!

I’m aware that we cannot stop the AI craze of big corporations, they will enshittificate the web despite some European artists opting out of their data policies. They don’t care if I’m on their platform. They probably already got all my data anyway. 

But I care about myself, and my work. We don’t have to be part of these social networks. What has been true since decades; since Social Media started, still is: The only right place to show your work online is your own website. Learn how to make and host one. It’s not that difficult. Send out a newsletter ([subscribe to mine!](/newsletter)). Own your tools. It feels really good.
