William Zinsser said something I often think about when writing: “I don’t like to write, I like to have written.” Admittedly I don‘t fully agree—sometimes, writing can be a cleansing and joyful process. But yes, it’s true, sometimes it’s hard. It’s hard to get started, it’s hard to stay focussed, it’s hard finding the right words. It’s hard to be witty and smart and all that.

I struggle a lot with the focus part. My life is full of distractions. Therefore I only have two options: Write on paper (which works great, but is a slow process), or move myself to a remote place far away from any noises or social life or internet access. But that’s not always possible. I am not Thoreau; I cannot hide in a Walden hut, not yet. Until then, I sometimes use a technique I found in Seth Kenlon’s [Use This](https://usesthis.com/interviews/seth.kenlon/) interview:

> For writing, I have a 2001 G3 iBook with a 500mhz PowerPC processor, 128mb RAM, and a third-party battery that just never dies. It doesn't seem to want to do graphics, so I just boot to a text console using Debian Linux.

I loved that idea! And I love the old Apple iBook from 2003 that I still had lying around. It runs Mac OS X 10.3; an operating system that is so old it doesn’t allow any of the fun internet distractions of the 21st century. The hardware does a great job at giving me focus, too: It’s such an act to set up the clunky old laptop that once I sit in front of it, I usually stay there. It’s too much in the way to not focus on it, and at the same time, it only allows one simply thing: writing.

Once I have my draft, I usually copy the .txt file to a USB stick, or throw it in the Public folder of my actual work machine via the local network.

Admittedly: A somewhat tedious process. But the process is always part of the deal, especially when it comes to writing. I love typing on that old machine. It gives me a cozy feeling. And that’s exactly what I need when I am in search of words, or wit, or simply: when I like to have written.
