During my media theory studies, we had a seminar about the establishment of the personal computer in ordinary homes. From a historical and media-theoretical point of view, we read and discussed essays and papers from engineers, philosophers and researchers from the 1960s to the late 1990s.

I loved the seminar as I finally found the time to read stuff by really important people who paved the way to modern-day computer interaction—people like Ada Lovelace, Alan Kay, Adele Goldberg, and (my favorite!) Howard Rheingold. His very well-written book “Tools for Thought” is [available online](http://www.rheingold.com/texts/tft/), and guides perfectly through the history of computers as tools.

During our semester break, I wrote an essay about one thing I found particularly interesting: The computer’s form and shape—and how it was always designed to disappear (eventually). With current technology trends like voice input and wearable tech, its starting to actually do so. I put a slightly shortened version only, have fun reading (if you’re interested)!
