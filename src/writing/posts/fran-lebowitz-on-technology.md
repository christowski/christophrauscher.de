People love listening to people with strong opinions. That’s why we cannot get enough of Fran Lebowitz, the New York intellectual with the (seemingly) longest writer’s block ever. In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S3XTsr3vIQ" target="_blank">video interview</a> for <em>Harper’s Bazaar</em>, she answers a variety of catchy questions on “the concept of Now,” as talking and having opinions seems to be her thing (and I admire her for that, no doubt!). The entertaining four-minute-conversation touches topics like fashion shows, avoidance of news, and of course, the internet.

Admittedly, I do find it a bit hilarious to ask Fran Lebowitz for her opinion on topics like internet friendships and artificial intelligence, while she clearly states that she does not own a smartphone let alone have an internet connection in her apartment. She also bluntly says that she does not understand how these things work. However, she manages to find a truth in it: “I simply am more worried about human intelligence than I am worried about artificial intelligence”—for what its worth; it will make us all dumb.
