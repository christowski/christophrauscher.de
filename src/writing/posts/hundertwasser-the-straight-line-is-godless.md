After years, I revisited the Kunsthaus Wien, a museum showcasing the art of Friedensreich Hundertwasser. I wanted to come back here because I recently remembered the architecture, which I loved, and wanted to ensure that my memory didn’t fool me.

Hundertwasser was an Austrian artist, painter, and ecological activist. He was interested in nature and our connection to it and expressed his ideas through manifestos, paintings, graphics, buildings and whole city concepts. He was a firm critic of growth and capitalism, and his art was always embraced imperfections—he was actively working against straight lines in all his works. “The straight line is godless” is one of his famous quotes.

Looking at his paintings, I noticed that I don’t care much for them. I like the simplicity of his watercolors and Japanese woodcuts, but the motifs—not my vibe. However, he was able to do something that I really do struggle with:

> “Hundertwasser would paint wherever he was at the time: at home or in nature, as well as in transit, in restaurants, trains, airplanes, hotels, and while visiting friends’ homes. He did not have a studio, nor did he use an easel; he laid the canvas or paper flat on a surface in front of him.”

What I really do care for, though, are his buildings. Hundertwasser had very progressive ideas of self-sustaining, ecological city planning, and some of his ideas were even realized. His buildings are well-known: colorful, wonky, with no straight lines (see above) and lots of trees and plants incorporated. The Hundertwasser house is a well-known tourist attraction, but it’s also loved to be hated: the excessive use of color, decoration, and the lack of symmetry work against so much of our learned understanding of what’s “right”.

Which was exactly what Hundertwasser was going for. Big parts of his architecture have <a href="https://www.hundertwasser.at/deutsch/ausstellungen/khwboden.php">uneven floors</a>, which are a joy to walk on. He called even floors “machine-made and not humane.” His descriptions and elaborations on walking on uneven floors are slightly too esoteric for my taste, but I do admit that moving through the uneven rooms was interesting and somewhat grounding. It’s probably easier to implement in rooms with no furniture (like, museums?), and it certainly has some accessibility issues which were not thought through at the time.

Hundertwasser dreamt of breaking up the concrete city, being an early inspiration for the concepts like the <a href="https://biotope-city.net/en/home-2/">Biotope City</a>, and a very early advocate for sustainable city planning. Looking at the climate crisis and our heated cities now (Vienna being a great, hot example!), some of his ideas are still very contemporary, even urgently needed. I generally love odd and playful architecture, such as the buildings by Inken, Doris and Hinrich Baller in Berlin, and I think our modern cities need more of that. More wonkiness, more plants, more delightful surprises. Revisiting Hundertwasser’s works brought that back to my attention. My memory didn’t fool me, after all.
