My illustrator friend Cristina Estanislao just removed all her art from Instagram and wrote about it on her new [newsletter](https://cristiestanislao.substack.com/p/see-you-never-mark):

> The question of whether instagram is expendable in our lives as illustrators in this day and age is a difficult one. I find it hard to quantify my personal gains from it.

After Cristina participated in one of my [Writing = Design workshops](/writing/writing-is-design-workshop/) a while ago, I stayed in touch with her work via Instagram. I enjoyed her drawings and seeing work updates. But while reading her recently launched newsletter, I noticed that what I really was after is her writing (surprise!); understanding her approach and her view on things. In her post, she particularly debates the question whether illustrators need Instagram as a tool to stay visible, and concludes to “exercise our freedom to not partake”:

> I am convinced, however, that we do not actually need it, and that most of the artists here underestimate the power and importance of real-life connections. By making our work so readily available to everyone for free, we are selling ourselves short, and if there is one thing I have learned over the few years I’ve been working as an illustrator, is that it is my responsibility to inform of my work’s worth.

Another post/cartoon from Carson Ellis’ newsletter _[Slowpoke](https://carsonellis.substack.com)_ is making its rounds on Instagram, opening with the question “Should I Quit Instagram?”—especially after Meta announced to train its AI with user’s content, and the very recent shift towards a hellscape-X-like platform without content moderation (and therefore, actively promoting hate speech). Carson writes:

> [Instagram is] addictive by design. It willfully destroys the mental health of children. Endless scrolling is making me stupid. It’s powered by anger and hysteria, it’s powered by (very effectively) selling me shit, everyone complains about it. Nobody seems to like it. Mark Zuckerberg is an asshole. Whatever goodness I manage to extract from instagram is despite its evil intent.

And Carson asks our collective questions:

> Would I know what’s going on in the world? Would I know what’s going on with my friends? Would they know what’s going on with me? Would I disappear?

The cat in the cartoon gives us the answer:

> That’s what they want you to think.

Moving away from algorithm- and ad-driven platforms like Instagram in the long run can only be a positive change. I understand that it can’t always happen from one day to the other, but seeing people understand how unreliable and ill-natured those billionaire’s platforms are, gives me hope and, honestly, a creative push. It’s fun to make stuff again! Even if the audience is smaller and the tools are less polished and we won’t get 10.000 likes and Moleskine won’t sponsor us and pay for our sketchbooks. We don’t need that. We need to make stuff. That’s the fun part.

I highly recommend following Carson’s newsletter _[Slowpoke](https://carsonellis.substack.com)_, and Cristina’s newsletter _[Hopeless Dibujante](https://cristiestanislao.substack.com/p/see-you-never-mark)_ (also published in Spanish!).
