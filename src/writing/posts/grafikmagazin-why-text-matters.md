For the new issue of the German design magazine <em>Grafikmagazin</em>, I was interviewed by <a href="https://www.typoint.com/patrick" target="_blank">Patrick Marc Sommer</a> for his  column “Zukunft gestalten” (“designing the future”). I got to talk about text as a design tool, and how I got into writing in the first place. I also explained why I think it still matters! Especially in times of quickly generated, machine-made and synthetic copy, designers ought to pay attention to detail. I write:

> As designers, we have two important skills: Paying attention to detail, and making the invisible visible. Writing, just like drawing, is good training for both. I believe that an insistence on precision is very important today. Our tools are incredibly fast, and at the same time we don’t want to live in a fleeting world where everything is only <em>good-enough</em>. Writing is a thought process to understand problems and recognize connections. If we make an effort to be precise, we gain insights that might otherwise remain hidden from us. Good wording can make our work more accessible - even to ourselves. Text is so omnipresent that we often overlook it. But our job is to look very closely.

You can get the magazine (which is beautifully produced!) <a href="https://grafikmagazin.de" target="_blank">online</a> and in well-assorted German book stores.
