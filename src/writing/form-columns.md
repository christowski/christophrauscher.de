    <p>Do you remember the sound of your modem dialing in to the internet, in 1999? Oh, or can you still feel the softness of the huge clunky keyboard in your parent’s office room? As we sometimes might feel overwhelmed by current technological developments, digital nostalgia seems almost like a safe haven to hide and relax. We get comfort from the memory of our music collection on our old iPod, or the slowness of social networks in the early 2000s, or the Windows bliss wallpaper that we all have seen a million times, at home and on every computer in the school library, and in the whole world.</p>
    <p>For Germany’s renowned design magazine <em>form</em>, published from 1957 to 2023, I wrote a quarterly column; published in every issue since 2021, about technological and digital artifacts. I traced back their history, their cultural impact and significance, and examined their current societal and technological significance. The column was published in German, until the magazine was discontinued in 2023. Until I have all texts translated, I will share some of the page previews here.</p>
    <p>I wrote about WordArt, Flip phones, Computer viruses, Screen savers, the iPod Click wheel, Microsoft’s wallpaper Bliss, Cloud computing, Desktop publishing, the button, Phone sex, the million dollar homepage, and digital cameras.</p>
    <p>A big <em>Thank You</em> goes to the editors-in-chief Nina Sieverding and Anton Rahlwes (now editing their new endeavour <a href="https://thethingmagazine.com">the thing magazine</a>) and to <a href="https://www.autostrada.studio">Autostrada Studios</a> for the beautiful art direction of every text.</p>
