It has been invisible at first. But over the past years, I noticed it more and more: this weird barrier between me and my computer. I spend so much time sitting in front of it! And recently, it seems like the connection between me and the work has eroded. There is a gap, or a crack, or a transparent barrier, and sometimes I can’t pass it by.

So why is that? What‘s the missing link? I still love computing, and work, and making stuff?! Is it the interface? All these open windows, but no fresh air? Is it the hardware? Am I finally ready for augmented reality goggles? Is it my crippled attention span that makes a flow state so hard to achieve? Probably a mix of it all.

This whole debacle of my work-desk-mind-disconnect reminded me of a course during my Interaction design studies at university, titled [The Screenless Office](http://screenl.es/). Facilitated by [Brendan Howell](https://wintermute.org/), the task was to translate contemporary digital workstations into analog workflows and media. The class was embedded within a broader artistic project, as Brandon writes on its website:

> The Screenless Office is a system for working with media and networks without using a pixel-based display. It is an artistic operating system. (…) It is constructed using free/libre/open hard- and software components, especially for print, databases, web-scraping and tangible interaction.

And, while the project is well over 10 years old, it touches on many topics that I still find interesting (and relevant) today. Like the idea of a screenless office as a counterpoint towards efficiency:

> [The screenless office] is freed from the implicit social requirement that new technological projects conform to standard principles of progress, universality and efficiency.

The radical removal of screens (and therefore current interfaces) as a way to kindle ideas and creativity again:

> These interfaces have become so embedded in our conception of reality that we now have a crisis of the imagination, where it is difficult to even think of anything different.

I usually find it tricky to apply an artistic idea like the Screenless Office to an everyday work setup (which clearly cannot be screenless), but it tickles a nerve: Within my social bubble, there is this constant longing for less screen time, more time outdoors, hiding under a rock, etc etc, and just seeing an utopia like this can ease the mind a bit: There’s always another way of doing things.

Three screen-free jobs I can see myself doing:
- Best Boy at a film set (I’d be labeling *all* the cables!)
- Gardener (I’d meticulously sculpt those trees)
- Choreographer (I have no clue what it involves exactly, but I think I‘d be good at it)

What would be yours?

### Goings-on about town (my timeline):

*On Liquid Glass:* I have yet to meet the one person who is excited about Apple’s new visual design language. So much has been written already, and I strongly resonated with Naz Hamid’s blog post about it: [Different Think](https://nazhamid.com/journal/different-think/).

*Frame of preference:* Marcin Wichary [takes us down memory lane](https://aresluna.org/frame-of-preference/) with Apple’s system settings, from 1984–2004. I just love a well-designed niche deep-dive like that, and I, too, was frustrated when Apple ditched its iconic system settings layout in 2022. A general life advice: Find your people who are as emotionally attached to a system settings layout as you are.

*Solar-powered blogging:* The [Low-Tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/) has been around for a while, but I appreciate coming back to it every now and then, as it touches on societal, technological, and sustainability topics like [public bathhouses](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2024/09/communal-luxury-the-public-bathhouse/) and [hot water bottles](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2022/01/the-revenge-of-the-hot-water-bottle/).

Summer has been idle, but is planning its comeback. My (phone’s) screen time average is currently down to 3.5h/day, and I can live with that. This was, by the way, the 50th edition of this newsletter—I’ll probably do 50 more. Thanks for reading!
