The loud and bright November sun screaming through my windows doesn’t seem appropriate for what’s happening in the world right now. It’s 9am and I am sitting at my desk, trying to focus and get the day started. Around me, notes, post-its and scraps of paper are piling up. Lots of ideas and fun projects I want to tackle. It seems that this month, as we‘re all asked to stay at home as much as we can, could be the right time to do it! It seems.

This year though, I often feel like I’ve unlearned everything. How do you start a personal project? How do people <em>write?</em> How do you manage life without any sort of structure? Comparing all my freedom with what I actually do with it, I tend go get slightly disappointed in myself. I could do anything, really, but nothing feels good enough. All I spend my time with is solving Sudokus.

Not everything is bad though. I’ve been involved in some really interesting client projects, I’ve been on the phone with friends more frequently, and how nice is it to find joy in simple things like a sunny autumn walk these days?!

Re-reading a newsletter I sent to you exactly one year ago (“<a href="https://christowski.de/blog/2019/11/112019-if-youre-going-through-hell-keep-going/">If you’re going through hell, keep going</a>”) also eases my mind a bit: Maybe it’s just November that emits these weird vibes. I generally take ease in finding reasons that are out of my hands. Destiny! I’m pretty sure something is in some sort of retrograde or a weird sun or moon or whatever flying luminary out there is involved if things don’t go as planned. Whiny millennial voice: “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/10/28/astrology-in-the-age-of-uncertainty">Not everything is our fault!</a>”

The climate catastrophe sure is though. I watched David Attenborough’s new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HC5E857ozg">Netflix documentary</a> “A Life on Our Planet” and can recommend it (which usually isn’t the case with Netflix documentaries, I often find them gimmicky).

If you want to zone out from the world’s disasters for a short moment, the New York Times “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/30/style/election-stress-relief.html">Election Distractor</a>” is the perfect site for you.

And, as I learned while reading last November’s issue again, looking at the past and finding the good and healthy stuff in it can also help to cope with things. I flipped through my Live Photos from this year’s summer and made a very short video from them. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGvYqG9qEui/">Watch it here.</a>

This letter’s headline is from Miranda July’s 2011 movie “The Future”. I’m looking forward to seeing her new film “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiMPCevu8Wk&amp;ab_channel=FocusFeatures">Kajillionaire</a>” once cinemas are open again.
