I am starting an attempt to live a more off-line life. I’ve always been a computer person, especially an internet kid, but this place and my relationship to it has changed. And while the web still does bring me joy, it also confronts me with a lot of anger—more than it should be. So, I’m trying to relearn to behave like a human made of flesh and bones, moving in an actual three-dimensional space.

While finding non-computer activities for myself was easy (sports, drawing, going places), making connections to others and finding a community that is not merely internet-driven was something I struggled with. I’m not necessarily awkward or strange around others, but I do admit that I always found it easier to get in touch with people through the internet, through text, or images. Turns out: approaching people without any digital layers, just through talking and a smile and my face (…)—it’s a very raw experience. So many insecurities and unknowns and possibilities (both of rejection and enlightenment!). But I’m learning. And I might even be getting better. Meet me outside.

### Good digital spaces
They do exist though, the good places on the internet. Sometimes, they might be tiny, narrow niches that just get uncovered by accident. I am thankful that Mastodon continues to be one of those spheres where I can find joyful digital spaces, and interesting people. Just one example: My internet friend [Javier](https://javier.computer/) created [PoetiCal](https://poetical.day/), a calendar feed that shows poems and little text snippets in your calendar. You can subscribe to it for free, and hand in poems and texts yourself. Every day when I open my calendar app, I find new little blocks of joy in there. If you need to turn your calendar into a joyful digital space again, I can highly recommend it!

### Human intelligence
A topic that’s hard to avoid these days is ‘artificial intelligence’, and I’ve been lurking and typing around it for weeks now. I decided that I’ll skip it, especially in this dispatch. I won’t let it take up more space than it needs. For me, it is currently not a massively helpful tool, and debating it usually just brings me more anger and frustration. It will keep doing that, as it stick around for a while, but I want to focus more on things that bring me joy: Real conversations, writing, drawing, being creative, using my brain, making connections (in my head and with others). I don’t need to obsess over it so much, and I want to practice what I preach: We don’t need artificial intelligence so much as we need [human intelligence](https://christophrauscher.de/writing/posts/fran-lebowitz-on-technology/).

My next screenless adventure: I will be visiting Warsaw for an extended weekend. Any pointer towards good restaurants, galleries, and odd city lore is highly appreciated. I will report (maybe). Until then: Enjoy the spring breeze, and treat yourself to some offline time from time to time.

*Post Scriptum — Now Playing /* This issue’s title is borrowed from a song I found on an old mixtape. I was gifted a CD from a very offline encounter, with a hand-drawn cover: a literal depiction of the mixtape’s creator standing at a pissoir, POV, so to speak. This drawing will live in my head forever, and I am so glad I still have the mixtape: [Ghosts — The World is Outside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgqqe_fAmkw).
