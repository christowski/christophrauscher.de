It took this text a while to make it through the foggy streets of Berlin. It was hard to move forward. Just like January: I struggled getting out of bed, as—except for a few sunny days—the city was buried underneath a thick, stifling blanket of winter. 

Even though I am not very active on the platform, the first people in my Snapchat stream started using Snap’s Spectacles—a pair of glasses with an integrated camera that records short clips and posts them to the user’s story. When Snap released the product last year, I was skeptical (as Google Glass failed and video-recording glasses just seem like a suspicious thing in general). However, when I saw the videos filmed with the device, I was surprised: The way you can take someone else’s point of view, as well as the user experience of the round video, was just fantastic. 

During the last term at Uni, I thought more about wearables in general, and how they need to be designed to actually work for their users. Fashion plays a big role, obviously, and I liked [this conversation](http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/25/14384112/apple-airpods-fashion-style-wireless-earbuds) about Apple’s trial and error to create fashionable gadgets. While I find the AirPods technically very interesting, I think their product design fails on a lot of levels (can you run with these things? Shake your head in disagreement? Wear a hat?!). Just like the whacky idea that thinner phones are better to hold, sometimes more (e.g. a cord) is more. 

In general, I feel that the more advanced the technology around us becomes, the more useless it appears to me. My Facebook stream was completely destroyed by algorithms, and so [I ditched it](https://twitter.com/christowski/status/817321004728991744). A computer with a touchbar instead of keys, that completely dumps my muscle memory?! I also can’t think of any use for voice-controlled home assistants, other than them telling me [facts about eggs](http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/23/14355878/amazon-alexa-skills-top-worst-egg-facts) (side note: I enjoyed Johna Paolino’s [essay](https://medium.com/startup-grind/google-home-vs-alexa-56e26f69ac77#.yemc5z6mx) about the different style of making conversation with Alexa vs. Google Home). 

A lot of products and algorithms are not only useless, but also fuel our fear of missing out so badly and shamelessly. Who wants that?! Just think of Instagram’s push notification when someone starts a live video: “XYZ started a live video. WATCH IT BEFORE IT ENDS!” How can one not become totally stressed out and anxious about the digitized world? In Manoush Zomorodi’s podcast [Note To Self](http://www.wnyc.org/story/fomo-jomo/), Anil Dash explains the great concept of JOMO instead of FOMO. 

Lets focus on that and joyfully miss out on some things in February. Valentine’s Day, for example. Ugh! I’ll stay inside for another month, and listen to the La La Land Soundtrack. I also loved listening to [Beulah](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0O5sXbPJPWbHKnbLfdLARS) (a band I missed out for long enough), and [Benji Hughes](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1w4UUVXVsk63VT2vTwx1e1). Happy February.
