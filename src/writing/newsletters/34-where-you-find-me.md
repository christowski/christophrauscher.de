Berlin is preparing for the snowstorm. It’s awaited for Sunday, temperatures are supposed to go below -10°C, and we’re expecting up to 30 centimeters of snow. This city is not used to it anymore; the last time I worried if my shoes were winter-proof was about ten years ago. But sitting in my apartment, as I’ve basically done for the past year, I’m excited for it. I’m excited for the sound of the snow, the silence of city, the brightness and the crisp air.

While I started the year with a big slice of uncertainty, January took care of things itself, and by now, lots of them are clarified. There’s enough work to do, and I’ve accepted that my motivation oscillates between “I’ll make this Wednesday a Sunday and stay in bed” to “LET’S GET THIS DONE”. As we all know, January and February are the hardest months to get through—mood, productivity and <a href="https://christowski.de/blog/2017/01/das-einzige-was-gerade-wirklich-auf-dem/">serotonin</a> are on their lowest levels. But we are already halfway through! You can find motivation in anything if you’re desperate. And if you can’t, it’s also okay to just stay in bed from time to time.

Not much else noteworthy happened in January. And as we’re going to be covered unter 30 centimeters of snow at any given moment, things might stay that way a little longer. So here is a short list:

* I’ve been listening to the new <a href="https://christowski.de/blog/2021/01/the-notwist-vertigo-days/">The Notwist album</a> on repeat the past week. It‘s eery and gloomy; perfectly composed for this weird time. My favorite song is <em>Into Love / Stars,</em> but <em>Where You Find Me</em> is also great and a very typical Notwist song.
* If you’re rather in need of uplifting music, give the new Baio album “Dead Hand Control” a spin (e.g. on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7yEA9KnVNoMC9yLZU89f1r?si=lk5p3WJOQJeM4WbqtWPxgw">Spotify</a>). It’s catchy and weird and fun to listen to.
* In case we’re not going to be completely snowbound, the Berlinische Galerie published <a href="https://berlinischegalerie.de/digital/anything-goes/">three audio tours</a> guiding you along remarkable 1980s architecture in Berlin. For me as a big Baller-enthusiast, this will be the perfect companion for snowy Sunday walks.
* For the readers who are more into nature than architecture: In <a href="https://twitter.com/christowski/status/1354368560722751489">this Twitter thread</a>, I received some great recommendations on where to meet animals in Berlin these days.

Animals can be great mood boosters during winter. Unfortunately I only get to see my friends’ and colleagues’ pets via Zoom, but the decision to get a four-legged flatmate is getting closer and closer. Just like the snowstorm! Stay safe, stay at home, and if you want: Stay in bed.
