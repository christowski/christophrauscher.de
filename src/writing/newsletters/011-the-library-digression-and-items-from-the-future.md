It’s 9.30 am. I am carrying my transparent plastic bag filled with a laptop, some pens and a book through the library. This place is quite ugly from the outside, but inside, it somehow works. A light-filled atrium connects the sounds of the entry hall with the desk areas and bookshelves. The noise level in here is perfect—not too quiet; you still allow yourself to breathe, and not loud; enabling the perfect concentration mode. I put my coat, my bag and my phone (necessary!) into the locker, stuff a coffee and a doughnut in my face, and find myself a desk. 

It’s basically a time machine back into 2013, when I spent most of January in this building to finish my bachelor thesis. The audience is a wild mix of art and engineering students, and they all appear to be very focussed and smart. I like to make myself comfortable on the fourth floor, between the sheet music and the multi-media library. From here, I can watch November’s rain, finish some books and finally try to focus on studying. I really do try, at least. 

However, I also allow myself to drift off from time to time, from link to link, book to book. In October, I briefly mentioned[Design Fiction](../10-golden-clouds-learning-and-minority-report). In class, we talked about this amazing project by the Extrapolation Factory, called[99¢ Futures](http://www.extrapolationfactory.com/Projects/99-FUTURES). It was a pop-up store which, for one day, sold various items from the future, like a Mars Survival Kit, void refills, or an “instant full university degree while you sleep”. I might want that one. Even more design fiction can be found in Mark Dudliks essay[“Speculations From Tomorrow”](http://designresearch.sva.edu/research/speculations-from-tomorrow/), where he explores the narrative of the Netflix series Black Mirror, for example, or Spike Jonze’s movie Her (remember Scarlet’s alluring Samantha voice?). 

Less fictional, more scary: Adobe recently presented a tool dubbed[“Photoshop for Audio”](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/11/adobe-voco-photoshop-for-audio-speech-editing/). From a 20-minute voice sample, it lets you manipulate existing and create totally new audio snippets—allowing people to put basically any word into any persons mouth. While it does sound like a disaster, regarding the current mistrust in media and algorithms, it really is what we have already gotten terribly used to with image manipulation. 

Further digression: My friend Caitlin is an awesome person and writer. Need proof? Read her[article about womanhood](https://medium.com/@caitlinschiller/i-want-you-inside-me-installment-i-what-periods-are-for-79a71e3635f9#.8kbbqnl4r)(is that a word?). Anyway, it’s relevant. 

I am not very up to date when it comes to trending topics and memes, but some fragments of the #mannequinchallenge slipped through to my phone.[This one won.](https://twitter.com/KP_Trill/status/796537204956925952)

This last day of November is my 25th birthday. And of course, I found myself thinking: “25 is basically 30, and 30 is close to 40, and 40 means full grown-up-status, and what else is supposed to come after that?” What a stupid chain of thought. However, it reminded me of Miranda July’s movie[“The Future”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPuusQf7eG0), where a couple wants to adopt a cat, and suddenly has very similar thoughts. They turn off the internet, start volunteering, loose each other, and everything falls apart. 

I don’t think thats going to happen to me though. I’ll hide here in the library, with some doughnuts and coffee, and if I stare at this open Pages document for long enough, it might start filling itself. Fingers crossed. Enjoy December.
