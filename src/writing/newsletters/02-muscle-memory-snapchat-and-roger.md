It’s February 29, shortly after 11pm. I’m sitting in Berlin Prenzlauer Berg, on an old but comfortable IKEA sofa. This day was a rare one. I hope you made it count!  

So. February. I changed my phone’s passcode in the beginning of this month. I’ve had the same four-digit-code for at least four years, and as my phone does not support any form of biometric identification, I need to keep typing that code to access my device. What I was not aware of though was the strength with which this code had been woven into my muscle memory. After 29 days, and over hundreds of unlocks, my thumb still is not quite able to perform the new numeric array. The struggle is real!

Sticking with phones (topic-wise): The new [qz app](http://qz.com/613700/its-here-quartzs-first-news-app-for-iphone/) got quite some attention in our office slack and in my twitter stream. Basically, it’s a robot that texts you the news. In a messenger-like interface, it provides short bits of information, and offers either questions to learn more on the topic, a link for further reading, or another piece of content. While the tone of voice is friendly and human-like, I only used it once for curiosity reasons, and never again.

What I started using more during the last month was Snapchat. We all struggled in wrapping our head around the confusing, basically also non-existing interface (swipe here, tap there, accidentally send an ugly selfie to a stranger and close the app in frustration), but I started liking it after a while. It’s nice to get so close to people’s lives, almost observing them, letting them carry you around their everyday life through the phone’s front-camera. While there are some really good snapchatters like my friend Eva (? hurraeva) or Cecilia (? motionandgrowth), who only use it when they actually have a relevant story to tell, it’s mainly a channel for nonsense and gibberish, which, honestly, is quite nice after a long day of work. Let the others do the talking. ? christowski1 (lamest nick name in the history of nick names.)  

Also nice after work: swimming. Listening to [this podcast](http://rrrad.io/post/138666883728/032-schulz-wichmann-1) by [Marcel](http://uarrr.org) and [Eva](http://hurra-blog.de) (it’s in German). Reading through [this beautiful and in-depth article](https://robinrendle.com/essays/new-web-typography/) by [Robin](https://twitter.com/robinrendle) about a new approach on web typography. Watching [every interview and TV show](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=roger+willemsen) on YouTube that has Roger Willemsen as host or guest.

His death earlier this month truly saddened me. I have been in awe of his work ever since I started writing; his way of telling stories and embracing life‘s oddities has been a true inspiration during my last ten years (I [wrote about one of his readings](http://christowski.tumblr.com/post/738935565/wir-erz%C3%A4hlen-uns-geschichten) nine years ago on this blog). When he passed away, so many beautiful, admiring and sad articles had been published, and they got me thinking: How do we appreaciate someone’s existance while they are still with us, without being overly emotional or pathetic? How do we let them know we appreciate the work they do, and the time they share with us? I find that hard sometimes, oftentimes.

Roger Willemsen wrote a quarterly column called Willemsens Jahreszeiten in ZEIT Magazin. [Here’s the archive.](http://www.zeit.de/serie/willemsens-jahreszeiten) Even though there won’t be a new column this spring, we have one thing to look forward to in March: Daylight saving time. _“Es wird Frühling!”_
