I am at a conference about the internet and mental health. It’s a one-day event and I only bought a ticket because I wanted to hear Katrin Passig and Felix Stalder share their ideas on how the digital transformation influences our brain, our behavior, and how our society handles the “New”. 

As the speakers discuss the meaning of digital endorsements and interaction (such as “likes”, “favs”, comments, etc), an older man in the row in front of me leans in to his neighbor: “I’ve never liked anything in my entire life”. 

That sentence stuck with me more than any of the talks or discussions. As an active participant in social media, of course I cannot imagine that someone never “liked” anything. What’s not to like! But out of context, the sentence is deeply saddening. Imagine this elderly person, sitting in a darkened conference room on a sunny day, leaning in to his seat mate, with a cold coffee in his hands, confessing: “I’ve never liked anything in my entire life”. I’m glad that the internet preserved me from this nightmare. 

I have liked and still do like quite a bunch of things in my life. Recently, these albums and playlists, for example: 

1) Baio – The Names ([Spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/album/7qS9PH5IULZCAvjKnLxjgR?si=hTPFL2DSSVy13zS4NbfTJw)). Chris Baio, known as the bassist from Vampire Weekend, makes cheerful indie pop music, and I especially like his album covers and this remix album ([Spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/album/4w4Rj4iZEAaqz3G0Xy4EzQ?si=x10gOTDfQ_C9_GbCIJLFvw)). 

2) Young Fathers – Cocoa Sugar ([Spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/album/03Dp6OJS4wd7dI1rRszPwj?si=dLCbqBT_Sn6vO06z6esP9g)). I know, I’m late to the party, but after their track Shame has been my workout soundtrack for MONTHS, I was looking forward to a new album—and it’s great! 

3) My friend Martin publishes really well-curated playlists on Spotify. Check them out! My current favorites: “[Charlottenburg Nord](https://open.spotify.com/user/moaddin/playlist/6gsrvYXvlhVNMJvlaIZNsX?si=BaQrcfxoT3iGJHPW0bkEXw)“ and “[Hits zum Vergessen](https://open.spotify.com/user/moaddin/playlist/4CqX1Zj20lIcK1ZkW21N4C?si=d12rVE7ERcuqz3A4e5W6LA)”. 

It’s intense how Berlin transforms from Europes ugliest/greyest/saddest/dirtiest city into the most wonderful place on earth during spring: I cycle through the streets and have exactly the same thought as every year around that time: There possibly is no better city for me to exist in than here. I hope you enjoy spring as much as I do! Have a good one, and talk to you soon.
