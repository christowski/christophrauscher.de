One of the hardest months of the year is coming to an end. The darkness of winter is eating me up, I want to hide inside and just wait till it’s over. Neukölln is not a pleasurable place to be during the winter months – I hate spending time outside after 5pm, which leads to a lot of home office days and me temporarily moving to my friend’s home in Prenzlauer Berg.

Something that helped my dark mood and misanthropy: Avoiding public transport. I stepped up the cycling game, buying thermal underwear, rain clothes, and made a DIY ass-saver (who would buy a bicycle without mud guards?!). When it was -10°C, my most important purchase was a pair of really expensive Roeckl gloves, which I lost one week later. By then, January was well-disposed; temperatures almost spring-like.

Also purchased were too many books this month: Brian Christian’s <i>The Most Human Human</i>, Sarah Ruhl’s <i>100 Essays I Don’t Have Time to Write</i>, and a couple of novels I want to read this year. The latter – <i>100 Essays</i> – is just a pleasure to read because it consists of really short, really fun musings on theatre. I tend to buy a lot of books and never make it past the first 80 pages, and for a long time I thought I am just not the smart book person I wanted to be. In fact, my attention span <i>is</i> very short when it comes to reading, but oftentimes, I also just choose the wrong ones. I had maybe two or three books last year that I read in one go, for example Mr. Penumbra’s 24-Hour Bookstore: A fantastic novel with simply the right amount of zeitgeist and magic. I bought it at The Curious Fox in Neukölln, which you should pay a visit if you’re into english books.

Other findings of joy this month: <a href="https://soundcloud.com/robag_fm/good-bye-15-hello-16" target="_blank">This set by Robag Whrume</a>; I did not listen to anything else. <a href="http://mevme.com/lizblog/die-erste-woche-jahr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elisabeth’s weekly writing</a>, especially this text after the first week of January. I fell in love with the drawings and paintings of <a href="http://aberlindiary.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Sholem Krishtalka</a>: An intense capturing of the city and queer clubbing scene in Berlin.

Two more months to go until spring is back.
