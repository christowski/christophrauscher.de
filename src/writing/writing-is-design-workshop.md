# Writing is Design is Writing is Design

We bridge the borders between creative and applied writing—and combine them. We share methods, tools and techniques. We practice freewriting and professional writing. Participants learn how to condense and transmit their thoughts via words.

Learn about writing as a tool. Make words work for you! Creative use of language provides you with manifold possibilities in your private and professional communication.

Writing is design if you know the how-to. Get to know your potential in dealing with words (this seems to be a field of insecurity for many visual designers). We’ll share techniques that will make it easy for you to get started. Fun little exercises, both orally and in writing, are our preferred method. Learn how to condense your thoughts via words. Learn to grasp your ideas and observations by describing them to an audience. Learn how to speak about yourself and the offer you make for professional markets.

The best thing: get instant feedback from the group, plus professional assessment. We will support you in finding your way with words. Let’s discover your verbal personality, try and bring it to full effect — thus adding to your visual identity, and making it even more convincing.

Elements of professional writing we will address: the functions of a headline, how to develop a title or name; text hierarchy, guiding your reader; the right tone for your target groups; the effect of short vs. longer texts; different formats, media, and verbal style, the tonality. Please feel free to bring your topics – we will try to include them in our schedule.
